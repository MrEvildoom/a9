Obviously, aRead runs much faster than sRead. This is because aRead takes advantages of being able to do disk_reads in parallel, so while the disk is reading it can sum previous reads or queue up new ones. sRead has to do reads one at a time, so every 10ms read is 10ms the processor can't do anything else.
